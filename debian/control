Description: A MIDI Network Gateway via UDP/IP Multicast
 A MIDI network gateway application that sends and receives MIDI data
 (ALSA Sequencer and/or JACK MIDI) over the network, using UDP/IP multicast.
 Inspired by multimidicast (http://llg.cubic.org/tools) and designed to be
 compatible with ipMIDI for Windows (http://nerds.de).
