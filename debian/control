Description: A MIDI Network Gateway via IP/UDP Multicast
 A MIDI network gateway application that sends and receives MIDI
 data (ALSA Sequencer) over the network, using UDP/IP multicast.
 Inspired by multimidicast (http://llg.cubic.org/tools) and designed
 to be compatible with ipMIDI for Windows (http://nerds.de).
