QmidiNet - A MIDI Network Gateway via UDP/IP Multicast
------------------------------------------------------

QmidiNet is a MIDI network gateway application that sends and receives
MIDI data (ALSA Sequencer [2] and/or JACK MIDI [3]) over the network, using
UDP/IP multicast. Inspired by multimidicast (http://llg.cubic.org/tools)
and designed to be compatible with ipMIDI for Windows (http://nerds.de).

QmidiNet is free, open-source software, distributed under the terms of
the GNU General Public License (GPL) [4] version 2 or later.


Requirements
------------

The software requirements for build and runtime are listed as follows:

  Mandatory:

  [1] Qt4 (core, gui), C++ class library and tools for
        crossplatform development and internationalization
        http://qt-project.org/

  [2] ALSA, Advanced Linux Sound Architecture
        http://www.alsa-project.org/

  Optional (opted-in at build time):

  [3] JACK Audio Connection Kit
        http://jackaudio.org/

  
Installation
------------

The installation procedure follows the standard for source distributions.
Unpack the tarball and in the extracted source directory:

    ./configure [--prefix=/usr/local]
    make

and optionally as root:

    make install

This procedure will end installing the following couple of files:

    ${prefix}/bin/qmidinet
    ${prefix}/share/applications/qmidinet.desktop
    ${prefix}/share/icons/hicolor/32x32/apps/qmidinet.png

Just launch ${prefix}/bin/qmidinet and you're off (hopefully).

Note that the default installation path ${prefix} is /usr/local.

If you're checking out from Subversion (SVN), you'll have to prepare the
configure script just before you proceed with the above instructions:

   make -f Makefile.svn


Configuration
-------------

QmidiNet holds its settings and configuration state per user, in a file
located as $HOME/.config/rncbc.org/QmidiNet.conf . Normally, there's no
need to edit this file, as it is recreated and rewritten everytime
qmidinet is run.


Bugs
----

Plenty still, after all this is alpha software ;)


Support
-------

QmidiNet is open source free software. For bug reports, feature requests,
discussion forums, mailling lists, or any other matter related to the
development of this piece of software, please use the Sourceforge
project page (http://sourceforge.net/projects/qmidinet).

You can also find timely and closer contact information on my personal
web site (http://www.rncbc.org).
